<p>Earlier this year some colleagues emailed around the latest paper
claiming a strong causal relationship between the solar cycle and some
Earth-bound phenomena, in this case the fertility and lifetime of people
born during different phases of the solar cycle in Norway from historic
records. Usually, such studies are cause for some mirth, and make for
useful examples of common statistical problems, see for example the
relationship between <a href="http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380707205_Verma.pdf">cosmic rays and car
crashes</a>,
or <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364682602000329">heart attacks and the solar
cycle</a>.
The study was carried out by a group of Norwegian researchers and
published in the prestigious Proceedings of the Royal Society B, and
could be considered to be a confirmation study as it notes that it is
supported by earlier findings.</p>
<p>The paper is <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1801/20142032">"Solar activity at birth predicted infant survival and
women's fertility in historical
Norway"</a>,
by <a href="http://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/gine.skjarvo">Gine Roll Skjærvø†</a>, <a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/frode.fossoy">Frode
Fossøy</a> and <a href="http://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/eivin.roskaft">Eivin
Røskaft</a> of the Department of
Biology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), in
Norway.</p>
<p>Being of a sceptical orientation I of course wished to see the data for
myself, as did numerous others. So followed an interesting email
exchange with the authors and several other researchers who were all
eager to sink their teeth into the original data. At first the authors
were very reticent to share their code and data, and they were
apparently unaware that Proc. Roy. Soc. B has a <a href="http://royalsocietypublishing.org/data-sharing">policy regarding open
access</a>, which is summed
up as "the right to read is the right to mine". It means that any
analysis published in their journal must support open code and data, and
so after this was pointed out to the authors, they shortly sent out a
version of their data and R code. Which you too can download exactly as
I received it
<a href="http://www.files.benlaken.com/documents/Solar_Norway_orignal_files.zip">here</a>.
If you struggle to reproduce all their results from these files alone
however you will not be alone, and I suggest you can <a href="mailto:roskaft@bio.ntnu.no">email Prof. Eivin
Roskaft directly</a> for further explanation
and potentially missing data/code.</p>
<p>The paper has received relatively high-amounts of attention and been
absorbed into news networks and social media. You can see the paper is
in the top 5% of articles in the
<a href="http://www.altmetric.com/details/3043510">Altmetrics</a> system, and ranks
in the 97th percentile of attention for articles published around the
same time. So, what are the claims of the article to warrant such
attention?</p>
<p>The study analysed Church records from Norway between 1676 and 1878,
examining features such as recorded births and deaths. The authors
reached several strong conclusions, such as being born during solar
minimum reduces the likelihood of surviving to adulthood by cutting
human lifespan by 5.2 years. The authors essentially proposed that this
was due to higher levels of UVB received by unborn babies.</p>
<p>When looking at solar-correlation studies, I often find that many are a
quagmire of messy logic, so much so that it is difficult to know where
to start assessing their validity. Personally, I like to go straight for
the core finding, the most significant result, and work outward from
there. If there is a problem with the core result, then I will consider
the study in error and stop, if not I will keep going until all claims
withstand scrutiny.</p>
<p>In this paper one of the most purportedly statistically significant
claims is that solar activity is significantly related to the number of
children born (fertility) in lower-class women, with these women bearing
on average 0.14 less children during the solar maximum than during the
solar minimum (p=0.027). This relationship did not hold true for the
higher-class women. The sample of lower-class women was drawn from 621
individuals over 162 years, while the upper-class women sample was drawn
from 1222 individuals over 202 years. These results are shown below, and
are a bar chart comparison of the mean fertility (with some uncertainty
estimate) for upper (wealthy) and lower (poor) class women in Norway.
Indeed, the upper-class women have a similar fertility in years of solar
maximum and solar minimum, while the lower-class women show a seemingly
clear difference in the mean.</p>

Now, I don't wish to be disparaging of fellow researchers, however,
there are common stereotypes in science that Biologists on the whole
have some issues with statistics and reproducible results (for example
see
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/irreproducible-biology-research-costs-put-at-28-billion-per-year-1.17711">here</a>
or
<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/fire-in-the-mind/2014/01/29/raw-data-widespread-problem-irreproducible-results/#.VXtbTWA7Spo">here</a>).
Indeed, it does seem to be the case here that the authors have simply
run some data through an R-package without clearly understanding what is
going on, and consequently are led to what I am now confident are
unjustifiable conclusions. I say this as I have gone back over their
data and created a simple IPython Jupyter notebook (available on
<a href="https://github.com/benlaken/Nbks/blob/master/Historical_birth_analysis.ipynb">Github</a>)
to see what is really going on. The details delve into a particularly
favourite topic of mine, random sampling. If you want details on the
method I use below you can find them in an open-access article of mine
published in the <a href="http://www.swsc-journal.org/articles/swsc/abs/2013/01/swsc130020/swsc130020.html">Journal of Space Weather and Space
Climate</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, my notebook shows the basic results of the fertility difference
are reproducible: this time instead of a simple bar-chart, I have used
notched box-plots. These show more details, in particular giving a
better idea of how similar the means of the population are, and also the
whole population distribution. The notches are in fact a statistical
test of a kind, they show the position of the mean value with a 95%
confidence. The figure shows that while the mean of the solar minimum
population is larger than at solar maximum, there is still pretty
clearly some overlap in the values. So the big question here is, how
significant are the differences in the means between the low-class
women's fertility at solar maximum <em>vs.</em> solar minimum? In particular, I
want to know are these differences distinguishable from random samples.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/Solar_norway_boxplots.png" /></p>
<p>Notched box-plots showing differences in fertility by gender, and social
class (female only) during solar minimum (blue) and solar maximum (red)
periods. See
<a href="https://github.com/benlaken/Nbks/blob/master/Historical_birth_analysis.ipynb">Notebook</a>
for more details.
Before I answer this question though, there is another important factor
to consider that should be quite a red-flag here. While the authors have
stated the original sample sizes of their groups (e.g. n = 621
lower-class women, n = 1222 upper-class women), this does not give you
any clear indication of how the samples are broken up when sub-divided
into solar maximum and minimum periods. From my box-plot I included
these numbers: You can see that for high-class women the split is 239 to
983, while for the lower-class women 125 to 496. Thus the samples are
certainly not even, and while this isn't automatically a problem (as
many statistical tests can account for this), it is a problem if you
wish to directly compare properties of the sub-samples (such as mean
values), because, as I will show below sub-sampling can result in
different distributions (particularly when the sub-samples are
relatively small).</p>
<p>So, how to see the statistical significance of the mean value? There is
an easy way with a Monte Carlo approach. It simply involves starting
from the full n = 621 group of lower-class females, and then randomly
taking a sub-sample of that population. You find the mean of that
sub-sample, make a note of it, and then repeating this procedure
over-and-over again, say 100,000 times (best not to try it by hand...).
The only complication is that you have to make sure that you are taking
a sample of the same size (n) as the one you are interested in
evaluating (in this case it means that the solar maximum and minimum
samples must have different Monte Carlo populations, as they had n = 145
and n = 496 respectively).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./images/Solar_norway_distrib.png" /></p>
<p>Monte Carlo distributions of random cases drawn from the low-class women
fertility data, with sample sizes matching the solar maximum (n=125) and
solar minimum (n=496)samples. The blue lines show the mean (and
uncertainty) of the actual samples. See
<a href="https://github.com/benlaken/Nbks/blob/master/Historical_birth_analysis.ipynb">Notebook</a>
for more details.
So, from the Monte Carlo approach, I created two distributions of mean
values, the results of which are visible as a PDF (probability density
function) as the grey shaded regions in the above figure. These
represent the null-case, that is to say that they are the means you
could expect to get when nothing special is going on in the samples
(i.e. this is what the range of values for no relationship between solar
activity and fertility should look like). To these distributions I have
over-plotted the mean value of the samples the authors obtained (and the
uncertainty, i.e. possible range of values), shown in the blue lines.
So, you can qualitatively interpret this figure by comparing the
position of the blue lines against the grey distribution values: the
more towards the middle of the grey distribution the less unusual it is.
You see immediately that the blue range is quite large, spanning a
considerable portion of the distribution in both cases, and is not
located in the tails (unusual portions) of the distributions.</p>
<p>In the end, this shows that the solar minimum fertility of the
lower-class women (of 4.09 ±0.12) ranks in the 77.8th percentile with
upper and lower certainty values of 96.0 and 41.51 percentile
respectively compared to random samples. The Monte Carlo has shown a
Gaussian distribution fits the data, and so I can use the sigma values
to estimate probability: The average value of the solar minimum sample
has a sigma of 0.77 (with an uncertainty range between 1.76 to -0.22
sigma). This translates to a two-tailed probability value of p=0.44,
with the potential to be anywhere between p=0.08 and p=0.83. So, nothing
unusual there.</p>
<p>The solar maximum sample mean (of 3.62 ±0.25) for lower-class women is
certainly more shifted to the tail of the PDF, at the 6.2th percentile,
and a upper/lower 95% certainty range of 0.4th / 30.6th percentile. This
relates to a mean sigma value of -1.53 with uncertainty over a range of
-2.56 to -0.51, relating to two-tailed probability values of p=0.13, and
an uncertainty range over p0.01 to p0.61. So while it is tending towards
significance in the most favourable estimates of the mean, it is
definitely not highly significant.</p>
<p>To me, these results do not support the authors claim of a highly
p&lt;0.05 significant difference between fertility of low-class women at
solar maximum and minimum. As this was the strongest result presented, I
am no longer motivated to check the results further, but if you are
particularly interested to further the notebook I am happy to accept
pull-requests.</p>
<p>I think it is interesting to note though, the authors go quite far in
their interpretation of their results, writing: "<em>Our findings suggest
that maternal exposure to solar activity during gestation can affect the
fitness of female children.</em>" They ask, "<em>Why, then, is the fitness of
women more sensitive to high solar activity during early life than is
the fitness of men? First, solar activity could differentially affect
the abortion rate of male and female fetuses. If only the most robust
male fetuses survive, while all female fetuses survive, male fertility
could be less affected.</em>". They go on to say "<em>[An] explanation for
the observed gender differences is that the development of the
reproductive organs is more costly in females than in males, and thus
more at risk for developmental abnormalities when exposed to a stressor
during organogenesis [44]. Concurrently, as the developmental period
of the reproductive organs in the two sexes is different, testicular and
ovarian organs most likely experience different hazards of in utero
exposure [44] to, for example, UVR.</em>"</p>
<p>This is a good example of how with a little data, black-box statistics,
some jargon, and a lot of imagination you can end up somewhere rather
far from Science. So, to conclude: I wouldn't suggest anyone loose sleep
worrying about having lost 5.2 years by being born during the wrong
solar phase, and I would say this is yet another example of why
manuscripts need to have code and data as visible and important as the
manuscripts themselves.</p>
