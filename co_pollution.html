            <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of 6 major air pollutants regulated by
countries such as the USA. It is a product of combustion like its
closely related cousin carbon dioxide, however, unlike carbon dioxide,
it is formed by incomplete or inefficient combustion. While carbon
dioxide is an important greenhouse gas contributing to human-induced
warming of the globe, carbon monoxide does not contribute to warming.
Unlike carbon dioxide however, it has the potential to significantly
influence atmospheric chemistry.</p>
<p>This is because carbon monoxide is a substance which has undergone only
a partial chemical reaction, and thus has great potential to react
further: for those of you who recall the OIL RIG acronym (Oxidation Is
Loss, Reduction Is Gain) from chemistry class relating to
oxygen/electron transfer, carbon monoxide is a reducing agent: i.e. it
removes oxygen from other molecules. Consequently, in combination with
other pollutants and the light from the Sun carbon monoxide is involved
in reactions which form dangerous tropospheric ozone and also urban smog
— both a nuisance and significant hazard to human health and the
environment.</p>
<p>Due to its reactive nature, its lifetime in the atmosphere is quite
short (a few months only). As a result, the concentrations of carbon
monoxide are very unevenly distributed (i.e. it is heterogeneous).
Without time to persist and travel large distances, the highest carbon
monoxide concentrations in the atmosphere are found close to emission
sources. This makes it particularly useful for highlighting centres of
human activity and also changes in activity over relatively short
time-scales.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide emissions have been measured in the troposphere
continuously by satellite since March 2000 by an instrument named MOPITT
(Measurements of Pollution In The Troposphere). It is an instrument
designed and built by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and housed
on-board NASA’s polar-orbiting Terra satellite. Horizontally, these
measurements cover the whole globe. Vertically they are most sensitive
to CO in the middle troposphere (~500mb or 12,000 feet). MOPITT
requires cloud-free (clear-sky) atmosphere to determine carbon monoxide,
consequently this causes some issues with high-latitude data (&gt;65
degrees), as problematic identification of cloud cover over
high-latitude ice-covered surfaces can cause some errors.</p>
<p>I recently performed a study on the MOPITT data, in this work—<a href="http://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/2/1/1">available
in the open access MDPI journal
Climate</a>. I initially wanted to see
if the pollution measurements could be used to identify periodic
variations in emissions over regional scales at time-scales of several
days to several weeks. Identifying cycles in pollution over large areas
would have been useful to explore the sensitivity of cloud properties to
human emissions - an important area of study in atmospheric science. To
do this, my co-author Tariq Shahbaz, and I applied Lomb-Scargle period
analysis techniques, and Monte Carlo significance testing. We used
relatively large spatial scales (Europe, USA, and China) as identifying
small-scale periods would not have helped us to subsequently examine
cloud properties (which are very noisy data, and so it is preferential
to examine them over large areas to reduce variability). An example of
the period analysis shown in the paper is given below for the European
region (you can see the paper itself for further discussion). Although
we didn't identify any cycles useful for this in this data, a range of
evidence suggests that such cycles they do exist at a variety of
horizontal and vertical scales (which we provide a brief discussion of
in the paper) and work on this topic continues.</p>

<blockquote>

de-trended CO data. A sub-plot shows a zoom on the only region of the
periodogram to show a statistically significant signal at the <em>p</em> &lt;
0.01 level -— the significance threshold is indicated by the red line
(calculated from Monte Carlo methods described in the paper). The
significant peak corresponds to a frequency of 2.286 days, and was found
to be an artefact, present at all domains, related to the orbital period
of the Terra satellite. Adapted from Figure 4–5 of Laken &amp; Shahbaz,
2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, we were motivated to use the opportunity to examine how
carbon monoxide in the troposphere has changed over the past decade.
Globally, the data shows an overall decline in the amount of
tropospheric carbon monoxide of nearly 7% over the 2000–2012 period.
This could be related to increasing efficiency of combustion technology,
and researchers have long noted that tropospheric CO shows a declining
trend driven by increasingly more efficient combustion technology
(e.g.<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/263/5153/1587.short">see here</a>).
For clarity, I note that it is perfectly possible for the greenhouse gas
carbon dioxide to be increasing over the past decade (<a href="http://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu">as they have been
doing</a>) whilst carbon monoxide
concentrations can simultaneously decrease.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Fig_global.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Globally averaged measurements of CO from MOPITT (Ver 5, Lev 3 combined
product) with 360-day running mean (red line). Significant linear trend
of <em>y</em>=-2.97×10^13^<em>x</em>+1.89×10^18^, <em>r</em>=-0.42, <em>df</em>=44, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01.
Equivalent to a net CO reduction of 6.58% (or 0.56% per year). Adapted
from Figure 1 of Laken &amp; Shahbaz, 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I note that I can’t say for certain that the decreasing trend is
completely physical, as long-term changes in satellite-detected
observations have also been known to be attributed to decay in the
instruments over time, as space is a harsh environment in which to
operate and instruments on-board satellites tend to decay, whilst at the
same time the orbiting satellites themselves loose altitude as a result
of drag on the Earth’s tenuous atmosphere leading to an inevitable
return.</p>
<p>I found that when you look at carbon monoxide changes over smaller
scales during the past decade the picture becomes more interesting than
a simple decrease. There are large differences between regions — these
reflect the changes in global society over the past decade - in
particular we see that although on average carbon monoxide decreased
over the globe, pollution over China, India and across the Asian region
has undergone statistically significant increases: these are almost
certainly linked with increasing industrial activity and economic growth
over the regions. Similar increases in different types of pollution have
also been previously reported (e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/abs/nature04092.html">increasing nitrous oxide emissions
over
China</a>).</p>
<p>I also observed an increase in carbon monoxide pollution over areas of
Africa and South America (although these changes covered a smaller area
and were less intense than those seen over the Asian region). Biomass
burning was previously a primary factor in driving emissions over these
regions, however, it is likely that the increasing trend over the past
decade is attributed to industrial development. Indeed, these changes
could represent a rise of major Southern Hemisphere contributors to
atmospheric pollution, with significant implications for air quality and
health over the regions, such as suggested by <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5651/1716.short">Akimoto
(2003)</a>.</p>

pixels, and (b) statistically significant (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 two-tailed
level) pixels only. For each pixel, the values are obtained by
subtracting the last point of a linear regression over the full
time-period from the first point (i.e. the values are a linear change
over a 1D time series of each pixel individually). For each pixel,
statistical significance was calculated independently by comparison of
observed values to a probability density function obtained by Monte
Carlo procedures. Adapted from Figure 3 of Laken &amp; Shahbaz, 2014.</p>
