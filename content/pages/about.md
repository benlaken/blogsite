*Experienced interdisciplinary researcher with skills in Python and Geo-related Data Science.*

I hold a B.Sc. Geography (2007), and a [Ph.D. in Physical Geography](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/2457/) (2010) from [Sussex University](http://www.sussex.ac.uk). My academic supervisors during my Ph.D. were Professors [Dominic Kniveton](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/122700), and [Michael Frogley](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/125380).

After Sussex, I moved to the Canary Islands, where I worked as a postdoc at the [Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias](http://www.iac.es/index.php?lang=en), associated with the [University of La Laguna](http://www.ull.es), in Tenerife. I worked on several projects there related to Earth's climate, on topics concerning albedo, remote sensing, clouds, and the effects of space weather on the atmosphere.

In 2014 I moved to Oslo, Norway, to work as a PostDoc research fellow at the University of Oslo, under [Professor Frode Stordal](http://www.mn.uio.no/geo/personer/vit/metos/frodes/index.html). I participated in the [ECCO project](http://www.mn.uio.no/kjemi/english/research/projects/ecco/index.html), led by [Professor Dag Hessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Olav_Hessen). This was designed to project climate change impacts on boreal fresh-water ecosystems and the services that they provide.

Notably, during my PostDoc research career I contributed to the IPCC AR5 (chapter 7), and also to an EU COST Action project, [TOSCA](http://lpc2e.cnrs-orleans.fr/~ddwit/TOSCA/TOSCA/Home.html).

At the start of 2016, I relocated to London, England to work as a [Research Software Engineer](http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html) at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk), as part of the [RITS group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/research-software-development). A position that bridges the gap between a researcher and a software developer.

I moved to Madrid, Spain, at the end of 2016, and will begin working for Vizzuality in January 2017.
