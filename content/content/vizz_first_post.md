Summary: Update after my first few weeks since joining Vizzuality as a Data Scientist

After having spent the last 10 years in Universities and Research Institutes,
I had seen many colleagues and friends make the shift from the
public to the private-sector, particularly into Data Science roles. I was unsure what life would be
like after making the change myself. I am now two weeks in to my transition to
life as a Data Scientist at [Vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com), and so far it has been quite exciting!

There are many interesting projects being developed here that feed directly
to policy-makers and influence public-opinion. Projects like the [Global Forest Watch](http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/global-forest-watch). And in some ways that feels a lot
like the day-to-day life in a high-quality university group, where people work on projects
or synthesis reports which reach the desks of critical people. Except, whereas
universities felt bureaucratic and institutional, Vizzuality feels dynamic and modern: It
works at a totally different pace, and generally aims at a far larger and more impactful
audience. Of course there is also the dimension of a profit motive behind the
private-sector, but it seems that at Vizzuality, the ethos is to actively push
towards projects and services that raise awareness,
and encourage responsible stewardship of our ecosystem at a planetary-scale.

Fortunately for me, my past year as a [Research Software Engineer](http://www.rse.ac.uk/who.html) at University College London
prepared me for the day-to-day tasks which I am currently working on:
As more time goes on, it's clearer-and-clearer that the [group](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/research-software-development) that UCL
(and [Dr. James Heatherington](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=JHETH53) in particular) created is the future-face of
Research in the University setting: the abstraction of the skills required to perform a
research project from the domain specific knowledge; creating effective teams
of dynamic computer-science literate people, who understand the scientific method,
and the way knowledge is created. It was, in fact, the creation of a Data Science group,
focused on research and reproducibility!

Consequently, coming from this group, I felt pretty happy to hit the ground running at Vizzuality, and in the past two
weeks at Vizzuality, I have had a chance to help them develop a new Open Source Python library called [sql2gee](https://github.com/Vizzuality/sql2gee), which converts
SQL requests into calls to [Google's Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com), and should let us easily use the
data on that platform in future Vizzuality products. So this has been very positive
for me so far, as I happen to love the Earth Engine, Open Source, and Python, not
to mention the prospect of contributing to projects that could contribute to creating a
more sustainable future. Exactly why I, and many others, became scientists in the first place.
