Over the past 4 years, more than 80 scientists from 20 countries across
Europe have come together, in an EU-funded COST project, called
[TOSCA](http://lpc2e.cnrs-orleans.fr/~ddwit/TOSCA/TOSCA/Home.html).
These scientists came from a whole range of different backgrounds,
including Solar and Space Physicists, Climatologists and Atmospheric
Scientists, and everyone in-between. Over that time, they produced much
on the subject of natural climate forcing mechanisms, including many
meetings, workshops, training schools, short-term research grants,
original research studies, synthesis reports, special journal editions
and outreach materials. But the crown jewel of the collaboration is
their [newly-launched
book](http://www.files.benlaken.com/documents/flyer_Earth%20climate.pdf),
titled '*Earth's climate response to a changing Sun*'.

The work, affectionately referred to by the group as a hand-book, is a
considerable achievement. It is perhaps the first time a group of such
diverse researchers have poured a titanic effort into discussing at both
great length and detail, across discipline boundaries, the role of the
Sun on Earth's climate, considering cutting-edge data and hypotheses.

Over the years it has been very gratifying to watch as these researchers
have come to common ground, evolving their ideas through collaboration,
exchange and comradery, until they hit intellectual bedrock. That is
really what the book represents: the hard-boiled core of the subject,
written to be the most comprehensive and agreed-upon synthesis of this
overwhelming and exciting field.

While I am personally sad that TOSCA has essentially disbanded and the
project is over, I am ecstatic at the achievements of the group which
they have distilled and calcified into their book. It was a pleasure to
be part of their group, which gave me many opportunities for developing
my research. To see my contribution to the book have a look at Chapter
4.7, written with [Dr. Jasa
Calogovic](http://oh.geof.unizg.hr/index.php/about-hvar-observatory/staff/jasa),
and modified with feedback from by Professors [Jon-Egil
Kristjansson](http://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/people/aca/metos/jegill/),
[Yoav Yair](), [Jeffrey Pierce](http://pierce.atmos.colostate.edu), and
[Brian Tinsley](http://www.utdallas.edu/physics/tinsley-brian/). I will
likely post a synthesis of this material in the future.
