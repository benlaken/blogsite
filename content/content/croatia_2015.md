Summary: A brief summary of a research trip to Croatia

![](./theme/images/Ben_Jasa.jpg)

I have just returned from a research trip in Croatia (8--19th
September), with my friend and long-time collaborator [Dr. Jasa
Calogovic](http://oh.geof.unizg.hr/index.php/about-hvar-observatory/staff/jasa).
Every now-and-then Jasa and I manage to have some schedule overlap for a
collaborative trip: This time, he kindly put my wife and I up the
beautiful [Hvar Observatory](http://oh.geof.unizg.hr), which is built
around (and inside of) a Napoleonic Fortress.

The theme of the trip was Sun: from the Sun-kissed Adriatic island,
Jasa's Solar observatory, to the research itself. Apart from taking some
time to develop future project strategies we wrote a synthesis paper,
tentatively titled *Reflections on the late Cosmoclimatology*, which we
hope will appear in the Central European Astrophysical Bulletin. The
piece briefly outlines the state the field of Sun-Earth links today in
relation to some of the grander claims over the past (roughly) 20 years,
and where future research lines are likely to yield interesting
discoveries.

We also made a final check after copy-editing of our contribution to
[TOSCA's](http://lpc2e.cnrs-orleans.fr/~ddwit/TOSCA/TOSCA/Home.html)
forthcoming book, which will be called *Earth's climate response to a
changing Sun*, the book has 61 authors, and was coordinated by
Professors Jean Lilensten, Thierry Dudock de Wit, and Katja Matthes, to
be published by EDP sciences. It looks great, and a lot of hard work
went into it. I will write a more detailed post in the future when it is
finally available.
