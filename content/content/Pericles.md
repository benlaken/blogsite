Summary: Reporting on an ongoing project to preserve scientific data

![](./theme/images/old_machine.jpg)

I recently attended a one-day evaluation workshop for the [PERCICLES
Project](http://pericles-project.eu) as an invited reviewer. PERICLES
([#periclesfp7](https://twitter.com/PericlesFP7)) stands for *Promoting and Enhancing Reuse of Information
throughout the Content Lifecycle taking account of Evolving Semantics*.
The aim was to give feedback and suggestions on the projects progress
and how they could meet their goals. The meeting was hosted at the
Belgium Institute for Space Aeronomy, in Brussels, and it took place on
29th October, 2015.

There were some very interesting/impressive people in attendance, and I
would say that it was an excellent opportunity for me to consider an
aspect of Open Science that I think is critical, but perhaps often
over-looked: While a frequent goal of Open Science is to be reproducible
and accessible, the need for preservation strategies are not so clearly
articulated.

Perservation Science is certainly a whole scientific field in its own
right. In researching this subject in preparation for the workshop and
listening to the presenters, I now think that the Open Science movement
should explicitly encourage an understanding of long-term data
preservation as part of its goal of ensuring long-term reproducibility.
This would including educating researchers and encouraging them as to
proper data documentation practices, encouraging the use of open
formats, integrity checks, authors selecting proper rights to the data,
and being responsible for some type of archival strategy.

Speaking after the workshop with the co-investigator of the project [Dr.
Simon
Waddington](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/research/waddington/index.aspx)
was particularly illuminating, and I now certainly hope that PERICLES
can succeed in impacting practices in the Scientific community. When I
think back over my own experience, it is very true that I have seen
large amounts of time and energy be wasted, essentially being trapped in
the past, through format or hardware obsolescence. (Indeed, my PhD
supervisor once gave me some [reels of magnetic
tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage#/media/File:Largetape.jpg),
relics of research past, effectivley useless now except as
paperweights.) This is of course compounded by software development
practices which don't consider portability or even attempt to be
comprehensible to future users!

Hopefully projects like PERICLES can help to break the status-quo that
"*Digital information lasts forever--or five years--whichever comes
first*" (Jeff Rothenberg, 1999).
